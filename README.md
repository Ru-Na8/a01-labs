How satisfied are you with the code and your solution, do you see any improvement areas? 
For each of the tasks I tried to be as simple and clear. Also, I've looked for each function and tried to learn what it does. next time I aim for a cleaner and  of course clearer code. For someone who has programmed with Python and then learns Java, there is a very big difference. Python feels simple and interpreted. Whereas Java has quite a lot of rules and a lot of code. It really feels to me as if I am talking to a young person and an older person, the young person should understand immediately what I want because we have almost the same language. While the older one, which is Java in this case, needs to be accurate, formulaic and detailed. But on the other hand, learning a new language feels exciting.

Did you do the optional part, if so, elaborate on how you solved it.

What is your TIL?
TIL is an acronym for "Today I Learned" which playfully alludes to the fact that there are always new things to learn, every day. You usually highlight things you've learned and where you might have thought a little extra about its usefulness or simplicity, or it was just a new knowledge for the day that you want to note.
